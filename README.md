Gesture Aid: 
Empowering Accessibility through Hand Gesture-Controlled Home Automation for People with Disabilities

In a world becoming increasingly interconnected, our project aims to bridge the gap between technology and accessibility for individuals with disabilities. Gesture Aid leverages the power of IoT (Internet of Things) to create a seamless and inclusive home environment, where individuals with disabilities can control and manage various aspects of their living space through intuitive hand gestures.

PROBLEMS FACED BY DISABLED PEOPLE: 

One of the main problems faced by disabled people is to access many of the facilities in the house without others help. Although technology provides remotes and voice recognition to certain facilities, it is not always possible that the remotes remain with the disabled people or their voices heard by the AI. So, it becomes difficult for them to access the facilities without others help
So our main motive is to provide them with facilities which uses hand gestures to make their lives easier.
